  Welcome to the MySQL ext/mysql->ext/mysqli Converter Tool.
  This tool helps you to migrate PHP files using the PHP
  MySQL extension to use the MySQLi extension.
  
  Extract the archive into a directory on your web server. Open 
  http://<yourwebserver>/<yourpath>/MySQLConverterTool/GUI/index.php
  for a Web GUI. If you want to work on the command line, try
  php -f cli.php.
  
  Note that absolutely no security checks are performed
  by the tool which prevent users from trying to read and convert
  files (e.g. /etc/passwd). Make sure to add security measures,
  if needed.
  
  If you want to run any tests, check the hints given 
  in UnitTests/README.
  
  Have fun!
